# Fish Species Prediction

This project predicts the species of fish (Perch, Bream, Roach, Pike, Smelt, Parkki, Whitefish) based on features such as length, height, and weight. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from the `scikit-learn` library is used to build the machine learning model.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 160 samples with 7 features, representing 7 different species of fish. The dataset can be downloaded locally as indicated in the [Fish_species_prediction.ipynb](Fish_species_prediction.ipynb) file. Once downloaded, it should be uploaded to Google Colab for further use.

### Fish Species:
- Perch
- Bream
- Roach
- Pike
- Smelt
- Parkki
- Whitefish

### Features:
- **Weight**
- **Length1** (Diagonal length)
- **Length2** (Vertical length)
- **Length3** (Cross length)
- **Height**
- **Width**
- **Species** (Target)

## Libraries Required
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `gradio`

To install the necessary libraries, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn gradio
```

## Preprocessing
- **Scaling**: The dataset is scaled using the `StandardScaler` from the `scikit-learn` library to normalize the data before model training.

## Model Training
- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (`KNN`) from the `scikit-learn` library is used.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using several metrics:
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1 Score**

## Gradio Interface
An easy-to-use, interactive prediction interface is built using the `Gradio` library in Python. Users can input various parameters such as weight, length, and width, and the model will predict the species of fish along with displaying its image.

### Input:
- Weight
- Length
- Width

### Output:
- Predicted species of fish
- Image of the predicted fish species

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-link>
    ```
2. Download the dataset from the link provided in the [Fish_species_prediction.ipynb](Fish_species_prediction.ipynb) file.
3. Upload the dataset to Google Colab.
4. Run the `Fish_species_prediction.ipynb` notebook to train the model and use the interface.
